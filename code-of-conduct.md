# tasteful code of conduct (1.0)

0. Fascists, racists, sexists, homophobes, transphobes, ableists, and other bigots may not use tasteful in any form.

## For users of the website

### Rules

1. Do not abuse another user as a joke or otherwise. Keep overt banter that could be misunderstood to DMs on another platform.
2. Do not participate in any form of vote manipulation. This includes creating a burner account to like your own posts, or creating many accounts to influence the average score of a project. 
3. Do not post pornographic content to tasteful. This includes child pornography. Explicit album covers are permitted, but may be removed with discretion.
4. Do not share files that were illegally obtained or are being shared in an illegal manner.
5. Do not spam your own content or others. You may post about your own content strictly only on your own page.
6. Do not attempt to illegally disrupt the operation of the tasteful website.
7. Any content that clearly infringes these rules is to be reported responsibility. It is your duty to keep tasteful a safe place for everyone.

### Guidelines

* Whilst these are not bannable offences, you may be warned for infringing these guidelines; this may influence your account's standing in relation to moderation abilities, for instance. 

1. Unless it is inherently relevant to the topic at hand, please avoid political discussion (especially in regards to economics).
2. Do not flame another user because they have an opinion you disagree with. Have constructive conversations and try to develop a deeper understanding of why a person appreciates something - as much or as little - as they do.
3. Avoid having an overwhelming positive or negative bias in your ratings. This will not be a concern for most people, but rating the vast majority of the albums you score extremely high may result in your ratings not being considered in the average score for any particular release. 
4. Do not engage with a discussion with the intent of ruining it.
